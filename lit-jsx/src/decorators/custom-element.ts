/**
 * Adapted from Lit's @custom-element decorator:
 * https://github.com/lit/lit/blob/main/packages/reactive-element/src/decorators/custom-element.ts
 *
 * The only difference is that this version creates a local map from the custom element constructor
 * to the custom element tag name. We need this so that the JSX runtime can avoid instantiating custom
 * elements simply to get the element's tag name that we need to forward to Lit. See {@link customElement}
 * for the difference.
 *
 * This is hopefully a temporary workaround to a current limitation in the Web Components API:
 * https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/issues/566
